# op-devstack

Devstack provides a flexible test-frontend, optimized for integration and network acceptance testing.

## Overview

### Packages

- `devtest`: `T` (test-scope) and `P` (package-scope) test handles.
- `stack`: interfaces, IDs, common typing, core building blocks.
- `shim`: implementations to turn RPC clients / config objects into objects fitting the `stack`.
- `sysgo`: backend, hydrates a `stack.System` with `shim` objects that link to in-process Go services.
- `sysext`: backend, hydrates a `stack.System` with `shim` objects that link to a devnet-descriptor, like Kurtosis-managed services.
- `presets`: provides options that:
  - configure an orchestrator (e.g. validate contents or add new contents)
  - hydrate DSL test setups (e.g. turn a test handle in system with DSL utils)
- `dsl`: makes test-interactions with the `stack` more convenient and readable.

### Patterns

There are some common patterns in this package:

- `stack.X` (interface): presents a component
- `stack.X`-`Kind`: to identify the typing of the component.
- `stack.X`-`ID`: to identify the component. May be a combination of a name and chain-ID, e.g. there may be a default `sequencer` on each L2 chain.
- `shim.X`-`Config`: to provide data when instantiating a default component.
- `shim.New`-`X`: creates a default component (generally a shim, using RPC to wrap around the actual service) to implement an interface.
- `stack.Extensible`-`X` (interface): extension-interface, used during setup to add sub-components to a thing.
  E.g. register and additional batch-submitter to an `ExtensibleL2Network`.

### Components

Available components:

- `System`: a collection of chains and other components
- `Superchain`: a definition of L2s that share protocol rules
- `Cluster`: a definition of an interop dependency set.
- `L1Network`: a L1 chain configuration and registered L1 components
  - `L1ELNode`: L1 execution-layer node, like geth or reth.
  - `L1CLNode`: L1 consensus-layer node. A full beacon node or a mock consensus replacement for testing.
- `L2Network`: a L2 chain configuration and registered L2 components
  - `L2ELNode`: L2 execution-engine, like op-geth or op-reth
  - `L2CLNode`: op-node service, or equivalent
  - `L2Batcher`: op-batcher, or equivalent
  - `L2Proposer`: op-proposer, or equivalent
  - `L2Challenger`: op-challenger, or equivalent
- `Supervisor`: op-supervisor service, or equivalent
- `Faucet`: util to fund eth to test accounts

### DSL-only components

Some components are DSL-only: these are ephemeral,
live only for the duration of a test-case, and do not share state with other tests.

Available components:
- `Key`: a chain-agnostic private key to sign ethereum things with.
- `HDWallet`: a source to create new `Key`s from.
- `EOA`: an Externally-Owned-Account (EOA) is a private-key backed ethereum account, specific to a single chain.
  This is a `Key` coupled to an `ELNode` (L1 or L2).
- `Funder`: a wallet combined with a faucet and EL node, to create pre-funded `EOA`s

### `Orchestrator` interface

The `Orchestrator` is an intentionally minimalist interface.
This is implemented by different external packages, to provide backend-specific functionality,
and focused on creating and maintaining shared resources for tests,

The orchestrator holds on to its own package-level test-handle and logger.
This package-level handle is not like the regular go-test variant, but rather meant for non-test-scoped contexts,
e.g. when running in tools or when running as global orchestrator inside a package-level `TestMain` function.

The global orchestrator is set up with:
```go
var MyTestSetup presets.TestSetup[*MyTestResources]

func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
	presets.DoMain(m, presets.WithMyExampleResources(&MyTestSetup))
}

func TestMain(t *testing.T) {
    resources := MyTestSetup(devtest.NewT(t))
    // resources.Sequencer.DoThing()
}
```

The preferred orchestrator kind is configured with env-var `DEVSTACK_ORCHESTRATOR`:
- `sysgo` instantiates an in-process Go backend, ready to spawn services on demand.
- `sysext` instantiates a devnet-descriptor based backend,
  and attaches to the network (selection is configured with `DEVNET_ENV_URL`).
  This may be a local kurtosis network, or a descriptor of an external network.


#### `presets`, `Option`, `TestSetup`

In addition to `DoMain`, the `presets` package provides options, generally named `With...`.

Each `Option` may apply changes to one or more of the setup stages.
E.g. some options may customize contract deployments, others may customize nodes,
and others may do post-validation of test setups.

The `stack` package provides helper functions to sequence options,
and compose options with different stages.

A `TestSetup` is a function that prepares the frontend specific to a test,
and returns a typed output that the test then may use.

## Design choices

- Interfaces FIRST. Composes much better.
- Incremental system composition. In the DSL package, maximize reusability by implementing DSL methods on the "lowest common denominator", e.g. prefer EL over Network. In tests, maximize readability by using the highest level of abstraction possible.
- Type-safety is important. Internals may be more verbose where needed.
- Everything is a resource and has a typed ID
- Embedding and composition de-dup a lot of code.
- Avoid generics in method signatures, these make composition of the general base types through interfaces much harder.
- Each component has access to commons such as logging and a test handle to assert on.
  - The test-handle is very minimal, so that tooling can implement it, and is only made accessible for internal sanity-check assertions.
- Option pattern for each type, taking the interface, so that the system can be composed by external packages, eg:
  - Kurtosis
  - System like op-e2e
  - Action-test
- Implementations should take `client.RPC` (or equivalent), not raw endpoints. Dialing is best done by the system composer, which can customize retries, in-process RPC pipes, lazy-dialing, etc. as needed.
- The system composer is responsible for tracking raw RPC URLs. These are not portable, and would expose too much low-level detail in the System interface.
- The system compose is responsible for the lifecycle of each component. E.g. kurtosis will keep running, but an in-process system will couple to the test lifecycle and shutdown via `t.Cleanup`.
- Test gates do not have direct access to the `Orchestrator`, since tests may share an orchestrator and should not critically modify what the orchestrator does.
- Orchestrators are shared: assuming a relatively static external kurtosis devnet or live network, the default operation for a package is to run against a single shared system.
- Orchestrators are configured in the `TestMain`, with generic presets, such that the different backends can support the preset or not.
- There are no "chains": the word "chain" is reserved for the protocol typing of the onchain / state-transition related logic. Instead, there are "networks", which include the offchain resources and attached services of a chain.
- Do not abbreviate "client" to "cl", to avoid confusion with "consensus-layer".

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure devstack:

- `DEVSTACK_ORCHESTRATOR`: Configures the preferred orchestrator kind (see Orchestrator interface section above).
- `DEVSTACK_KEYS_SALT`: Seeds the keys generated with `NewHDWallet`. This is useful for "isolating" test runs, and might be needed to reproduce CI and/or acceptance test runs. It can be any string, including the empty one to use the "usual" devkeys.
- `DEVNET_ENV_URL`: Used when `DEVSTACK_ORCHESTRATOR=sysext` to specify the network descriptor URL.
- `DEVNET_EXPECT_PRECONDITIONS_MET`: This can be set of force test failures when their pre-conditions are not met, which would otherwise result in them being skipped. This is helpful in particular for runs that do intend to run specific tests (as opposed to whatever is available). `op-acceptor` does set that variable, for example.

Rust stack env vars:
- `DEVSTACK_L2CL_KIND=kona` to select kona as default L2 CL node
- `DEVSTACK_L2EL_KIND=op-reth` to select op-reth as default L2 EL node
- `KONA_NODE_EXEC_PATH=/home/USERHERE/projects/kona/target/debug/kona-node` to select the kona-node executable to run
- `OP_RETH_EXEC_PATH=/home/USERHERE/projects/reth/target/release/op-reth` to select the op-reth executable to run

Go stack env vars:
- `DEVSTACK_L1EL_KIND=geth` to select geth as default L1 EL node
- `SYSGO_GETH_EXEC_PATH=/path/to/geth` to select the geth executable to run

Other useful env vars:
- `DISABLE_OP_E2E_LEGACY=true` to disable the op-e2e package from loading build-artifacts that are not used by devstack.
