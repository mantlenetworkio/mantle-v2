## Usage

From `op-service` dir:
```bash
# Run Go tests
make test
# Run Go fuzz tests
make fuzz
```

## Product

### Optimization target

Provide solid reusable building blocks for all OP-Stack Go services.

### Vision

- Remove unused utilities: `op-service` itself needs to stay maintainable.
- Make all Go services consistent: `op-service` modules can be used to simplify and improve more Go services.

## Design principles

- Reduce boilerplate in Go services: provide service building utils ranging from CLI to testing.
- Protect devs from sharp edges in the Go std-lib: think of providing missing composition,
  proper resource-closing, well set up network-binding, safe concurrency utils.

## Testing

Each op-service package has its own unit-testing.
More advanced utils, such as the transaction manager, are covered in `op-e2e` as well.
