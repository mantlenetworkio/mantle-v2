# Configuration file for acceptance tests (op-acceptor)
#
# All acceptance tests need to be registered here for op-acceptor to run them.
# As a rule of thumb, we recommend that each fork gate inherits from the
# base gate as well as any earlier fork gates.

gates:
  # New tests should be added here first with an owner metadata.
  # Once we're confident they're not flaky, a PR will be automatically created to remove them from this gate.
